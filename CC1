* Every mother in the world goes through lot of struggles to raise a kid, that too raising a mischievous kid is like trying to straighten the dog's tail, you give a nice slap, scream, yell at the end of the day mischievous kids will do what they want to do. When I say mischievous kid, I mean the kids who tries to put nail switch board, who breaks the TV with the cricket ball, who runs the bicycle on someone's foot. Fellow toastmasters my "Ice breaker" session is about such a mischievous kid. I will just share three of my life's mischievous events. 
Event 1:- BlueCross
* If my memory is correct, my first mischievous activity is on nice Saturday, to be precise it is "Puratasi" Saturday which is a auspicious day for Lord Venky. My mom is notoriously famous among our relatives and neighbors for doing the Pooja, whoever comes to our home on Pooja day can feel like they are entering the home of a god, it will be full of smoke created from camphor and candle lights, someone who is looking into my home from street, may call Fire Service. Like any other auspicious day, my mother was busy cleaning our home, cooking tasty foods and preparing for pooja. Since it is Saturday, as usual I was not at home, I was roaming around the streets with my friends. While moving around I just found bunch of new born puppies without their mom dog, puppies were whining and crying, I did not know why it was screaming, may be hungry, may be no one to feed, So I immediately decided I need to raise that puppies and brought that puppies in to my home with help of my friends, and kept it in middle of our home. I went to kitchen took the freshly made vada and tried to feed it to the puppies. Meanwhile my mom started doing the pooja, chanting the slogans and moving around the home with fire and ringing the bell, hearing all this noise puppies started screaming loud and running around the home creating a big havoc. Accidently my mom bumped on one of the puppy and it gave a small bite in my mom's foot, it scared the hell out of my mom, she dropped all her Pooja utensils and shouting who brought the dog in to home that too on auspicious day. I was in corner of the hall looking at the fun happening in front of my eyes, now my mom found who is the culprit for all this havoc and Usain Bolt inside me waked up, but my mom is a smart lady sensed my intention, she ran faster than me and locked the door of our house. Then finally Saturday Puratasi Pooja happened not to Lord Venky but on me.
Event 2:- Egg
* I was too skinny during my school days, aunt next door make fun of me telling “Keep me away from strong winds”, this angered my mother, so put on weight she started high nutrient foods like spinach, health mix, boiled eggs etc. Like any other child, I don’t like yolk of the egg. But my mom insist ever time that is where high strength lies. Only before a week I got to know that is a complete lie because yolk has only cholesterol. Coming back story, one nice afternoon, I was telling my friends how much I hate egg yolk, one of my friend suggested a work around for it. Let us mix the egg yolk with rice, sambar, vegetables and eat, so you don’t feel like you are eating egg yolk. I prepared my cocktail of meals and egg yolk, and it tasted good, so I started distributing my new found cuisine to my friends. It includes a Brahmin friend, who ate my cocktail with profound happiness. Once he done with the food, he asked me what is it, I told my formula of mixing rice, sambar, vegetables and egg yolk, he suddenly started crying for having egg. The news of a brahmin having egg spread like wildfire in my school eventually to Head Master and then to my parents and friend’s parents. Next day I was taken to my head master office, ther I could find my father and mother and my Friend’s parents and my class teacher. My mom was looking at me ferociously like "Come home today, we have wrestling". Using this opportunity, my class teacher opened all the old cases to my mother. Finally they decided no one should bring non-vegetarian food to school. Nevertheless to tell, I indeed had wrestling in home, and winner is my mom.
Event 3:- Superstar
* Like any other 90's kids, I was a big fan of Rajinikanth. Once I was sitting and practicing throwing the pencil in to my mouth pretending like a cigarette, I had a string blow in my head, fell down along with my virtual cigarette, it was my dad yelling "What habit are you trying?.". Every day my mom combs my hair neatly and look at me with proud that how her kid is very innocent and obedient. She does not know how much I hated combing my hair neatly. That was the point I was looking for an inspiration for a hair style and found through Superstar. To achieve superstar hairstyle, as soon as I come out of my home, I will mess up my hair intentionally. My inspiration does not stop there, bought a pouch which can be tied around my hip going to school with all my pencil, sharpener in it and also fighting with my classmates thinking they are some goons and I am saving the class from them. One day the fight took a serious turn, my friend got hurt in his mouth, the news spread to head master eventually to his parents and my parents. Head master was threatening if any issue happens again in future, I may need to find another school. It has not stopped my inspiration for Rajnikanth, I was walking very proud into my home that I had fight, but finding my mom having her tools in hand all my inspiration turned into fear. You guessed right, my mom showed some of her fighting skills inspired from Rajinikanth.
* Like I enjoyed doing all my mischievous acts, now my mom is enjoying telling this to everyone, with her final touch of quotes "Even though my son is very mischievous when he was a kid now he is very disciplined and obedient".
