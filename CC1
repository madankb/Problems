Body:
* Every mother in the world goes through lot of struggles to raise a kid, that too raising a mischievous kid is like trying to straighten the dog's tail,  mom gives you give a nice slap, you scream, yell,at the end of the day mischievous kids will do what they want to do. When I say mischievous kid, I mean the kids who tries to put nail inside the switch board, who breaks the TV with the cricket ball, who runs the bicycle on someone's foot?. Fellow toastmasters my "Ice breaker" session is about such a mischievous kid. I will just share three of my life's mischievous events. 
Event 1:- BlueCross
* If my memory is correct, my first mischievous activity: is on nice One fine Saturday morning  when I was in 8 or 9th class, to be precise it  was "Puratasi" Saturday which is a auspicious day for Lord Venky. My mom is  especially famous among our relatives and neighbours for doing the Pooja, whoever comes to our home on Pooja day can feel like they are entering the home of a god, it will be full of smoke created from camphor and candle lights, someone who is looking into my home from street, may think to  call the Fire Service. Like any other So on this auspicious day, my mother was busy cleaning our home, cooking tasty foods and preparing for pooja. Since it   was Saturday, as usual I was not at home, I was roaming around the streets with my friends. While moving around I just  saw bunch of new born puppies without their mom dog, puppies were whining, I did not know why it was screaming, may be hungry,  or may be no one to feed, So I immediately decided I need to raise  these puppies and brought  them  to my home with help of my friends, and kept it in middle of our home. I went to thekitchen took the freshly made vada and tried to feed it to the puppies. Meanwhile my mom started doing the pooja, chanting the slogans and moving around the home with fire and ringing the bell, hearing all this noise puppies started screaming loud and running around the home creating a big havoc. Accidently my mom bumped onto one of the puppy and it gave a small bite in my mom's foot, it scared the hell out of my mom, she dropped all her Pooja utensils and shouted who brought these puppies  in to the home that too on auspicious day. I was standing in corner of the hall looking at the fun happening in front of my eyes, now my mom found who is the culprit for all this havoc and Usain Bolt inside me  woke up, but my mom is a smart lady   sensing my intention, she ran faster than me and locked the door of our house. Then finally Saturday Puratasi Pooja happened not to Lord Venky but  to  me.
Event 2:- Egg
* I was too skinny during my school days, aunt next door made fun of me, telling “Keep me away from strong winds”, this angered my mother very much, so to   increase my weight she started giving me highly  nutritious  foods like spinach, health mix, boiled eggs etc. Like any other  kid, I don’t like egg yolk . But my mom insisted every time to eat this boiled egg saying  this  is where high strength lies. Only before a week I   came to know that  it is a complete lie because yolk has only cholesterol. Coming back to the story, one  fine afternoon, I was telling my friends how much I hate egg yolk, one of my friend suggested  a solution for it. Let us mix the egg yolk with rice, sambar, vegetables and eat, so that you don’t feel like  eating the egg yolk. I prepared my cocktail of meals   with egg yolk, and it tasted good, so I started distributing my new found cuisine to my friends. It includes a Brahmin friend, who ate my cocktail with profound happiness. Once he  finished  the  meals, he asked me what  was that tasty meal, I told my formula of mixing rice, sambar, vegetables and egg yolk, he suddenly started crying for having egg. The news of a brahmin boy having egg, spread like the wildfire in my school eventually to the Head Master and then to my parents and friend’s parents. Next day I was  called to my head master office, their I could find my father and mother and my Friend’s parents and my class teacher. My mom was looking at me ferociously like "Come home today, we will have wrestling match". Using this opportunity, my class teacher opened all the old cases to my mother. Finally they decided that  no one should bring non-vegetarian food to the school. Nevertheless to  say ,  we indeed had the wrestling match  at  home, and the obvious winner  was my mom.
Event 3:- Superstar
* Like any other 90's kid, I was a big fan of Rajinikanth. Once I was sitting and practicing throwing the pencil in to my mouth pretending like a cigarette, suddenly I   got  a  strong  knock  on my head, I fell down along with my virtual cigarette, it was my dad yelling "What habit are you trying to copy?.".  During My School days my mom use to combs my hair neatly and look at me with proud that how her  son is very innocent and obedient. She  did not know how much I hated combing my hair neatly. That was the point when  I was looking for an inspiration for a hair style and found it through the Superstar. To achieve superstar hairstyle, as soon as I come out of my home, I  would  mess up my hair intentionally. My inspiration does not stop there, bought a pouch which can be tied around my hip  taking it the to school with all my pencil, sharpener in it and also fighting with my classmates thinking they are some goons and I am saving the class from them. One day the fight took a serious turn, my friend got hurt in his mouth, the news spread to head master eventually to his parents and my parents. Head master was threatening if any issue happens again in future, I may need to find another school.  this incident  did  not stop my inspiration for Rajnikanth, I was walking very proudly into my home that I had fight, but finding my mom having her tools in hand all my inspiration turned into fear. You guessed right, my mom showed some of her fighting skills inspired from Rajinikanth.
* Like I enjoyed doing all my mischievous acts, now my mom is enjoying telling this to everyone, with her final touch of quotes "Even though my son is very mischievous when he was a kid now he is very disciplined and obedient".
